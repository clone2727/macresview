macresview 0.0.1
================

What is it?
***********
	A simple tool to extract data from Mac resource forks. After two years of being used as a very hacky tool, LordHoto nudged me into releasing it for public consumption.

How do I build it?
******************
	1) Type 'make'
	2) If that doesn't work, submit a pull request that fixes it

How do I use it?
****************
	From the command line! Run "./macresview" to see what options are available.

What can it do?
***************
	Currently, there are only three things it can do: it can list resources, do a raw dump of resources, and extract PICT/snd files. Note: Only snd files that are raw PCM are supported. It also can extract icons to .icns files.
